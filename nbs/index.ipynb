    "> Quantum Fisher(man) project developed for the <a href='https://qiskithackathoneurope.bemyapp.com'>IBM Qiskit Hackathon 2021</a>. We provide a toolkit to compute the overlap between quantum states. We apply it to obtain the quantum Fisher information from quantum circuits, which allows the optimization through advanced techniques such as the <a href='https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-05-25-269/pdf/'> quantum natural gradient</a>, as well as to study the loss landscape of such circuits. Furthermore, we provide a functionality to compute the overlap between quantum states from devices, enabling device-independent certification. "

    "## Quantum Fisher information\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fisher information is a key metric widely used in physics and optimization. It has recently gathered great interest due to its applications in Machine Learning (ML), as it provides information about the local curvature of the Loss function, which can be leveraged to enhance vanilla gradient descent algorithms to perform [natural gradient](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/10/2/251/6143/Natural-Gradient-Works-Efficiently-in-Learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Its quantum version, the quantum Fisher information (QFI), plays a fundamental role in [multiple fields of quantum physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15191) such as quantum metrology, quantum information processing and quantum many-body physics. Furthermore, it lies at the core of recent quantum algorithms, such as the [quantum natural gradient](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-05-25-269/pdf/), variational quantum imaginary time evolution or [quantum Boltzmann machines](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.021050).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the QFI is not directly related to any physical observable, which makes it very hard to measure. While fileds like quantum sensing or quantum machine learning would greatly benefit from it, its elevetaed cost makes it impractical to use in actual applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "A central element in the calculation of the QFI is the notion of distance between quantum states, which corresponds to their overlaps. In this hackathon we have developed a toolbox to compute the overlap between quantum states implementing various methods that do not require the explicit calculation of the state-vectors. Even more, they allow the computation of overlaps between mixed states and states in different devices. "

    "## Quantum Overlaps\n",
    "\n",
    "The overlap between two states $\\rho_0, \\rho_1$ is defined as the trace of their product $\\text{Tr}\\left[\\rho_0\\rho_1\\right]$ and measures the similarity between the two states. For pure states, the overlap coincides with the Fidelity and can be expressed as $|\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle|^2$ for two pure states $|\\psi\\rangle, |\\phi\\rangle$. This quantity also defines the purity, which is the overlap of a state with itself and it is one for pure states. \n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large systems, the direct calculation of the overlap is impractical as it requires either full knowledge of the density matrices or the state vectors. Here, we provide three methods to compute the overlap between quantum states that do not require the explicit calculation of such quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compute-uncompute**: this method relies on the prepartion of a state through a unitary evolution of the zero state, followed by the \"un-preparation\" of another state to then measure the initial zero state. Then, the value of the overlap is the probability of measuring zero at the end. \n",
    "- **Swap test**: this method builds a circuit containing the two states to be compared and an additional qubit. The extra qubit serves as control for a set of controled swap gates between the states. The fidelity is obtained as a function of the probability to measure the zero state in the additional qubit. \n",
    "- **Random measurements**: this method performs a series of random measurements implmenting a series of random unitary gates. It then infers the value of the overlap from the resulting statistics from the random measurements. We extend the method compute the overlap across different quantum devices."
